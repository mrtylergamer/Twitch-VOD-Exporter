# Twitch-VOD-Exporter
a tool that uses Tampermonkey to automatically export VODS to youtube (Work in progress)

This is a relatively basic script Made to just partially automate my export to youtube 
Unknown if this has issues with twitch tos


All I ask if you do edit or publish this code is some credit (and maybe a follow on twitch ðŸ˜‚ https://twitch.tv/mrtylergamer)

**Requirements** 
Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php)
A Youtube account Linked to your twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections)


**How to Use**
1. Download the script [Here](https://github.com/mrtylergamer/Twitch-VOD-Exporter/raw/main/Twitch%20Auto%20Export.user.js)
2. Goto Twitch Video producer (https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/YOUR_USERNAME/content/video-producer)
3. Let the script run
4. When its done Press export (This is intentional to prevent Violating Twitch TOS)


**This script is configured only to activate on (https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/*/content/video-producer) and has no access to User tokens or logins**
